# Email Sender
This is a simple Python script to automate email sending. <br><br>

The idea comes from a small story during my time as an Instructional Support Assistant. <br>
Usually, we would upload marksheets on MarkUs for students to view their assignment feedback. <br>
Unfortunately, there's a 2% chance of the upload script being buggy. <br>
And when that happens, we have to do a lot of manual work to send marksheets to students. <br>
The creator of the script deemed it way too much pain to fix the bug(s). <br>
So we brainstormed some other methods to send students their feedback. <br>
One of which is sending the marksheets via email. <br>
And this script is me experimenting with that method. <br>
The other method is putting the marksheets on the course website, which is under our control, unlike MarkUs. <br>
And to be honest, I kinda prefer the course website more, even though it would mean we have to do fullstack stuff. <br>
Because credentials are an even bigger pain. <br><br>

That said, the main idea of this script is to login as a Gmail user and send the emails. <br>
If you're wondering "Why Gmail and not Outlook?", then it's because I don't know how to deal with 2FA on my Outlook account (for now). <br>
That said, see ya next time!
